# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

   Python is a high level programming language which is simple and readable and is used for web development,data analysis,artificial intelligence and also scientific computing.
   Python is easy to learn and read because of its straightforward syntax thus making it accessible for beginners and appealing to experienced programmers.
   Python is versatile  since it supports many programming paradigms allowing developers to choose the approach that suits them.
   Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its growth.
   Python comes with a large standard library that provides modules and packages for tasks.
   Python is suitable for small scale projects as well as large scale projects and complex applications.
   Python is widely available and on various platforms including windows,linux,unix,MacOS.
   Python can easily integrate with other programming languages e.g C++,C and Java via bindings allowing developers to leverage existing codespaces and libraries.
   Python excels in automating tasks due to its simplicity and readability.
   Python can be used in web development,its frameworks such as django and flask are very useful for building web applications.It can also be used in data analysis and visualization,NumPy,Pandas and Matplotlib are used for data analysis,exploration and praparation.It can also be used in machine learning and artificial intelligence.Python can also be used in scientific computing and computational science due to its libraries like SciPy,SymPy and Biopython.It can be used in Automation and scripting for system administration,batch processing,file manipulation and automated testing.It is also used in Prototyping,web scripting,game development and many other areas.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

   First go to the official python website and navigate to downloads sections from the top menu.
   Choose the latest python version suitable for your PC.
   Run the installer by downloading and then locate the downloadede file and double click on it to run.
   On the first installer screen,check the box that says add to path and click on install now button.
   Once the installation is complete, you can verify by it by opening command prompt and type 'python --version ' to check the version installed.One can also start python intepreter by typing 'python' in the command prompt.
   There is also need to install additional packages, they can be installed using 'pip'.Install virtual environment by typing 'pip install virtualenv' then cd to change directory to the project folder where the the vitual environment is to be created.Create vitual environment by running 'virtualenv ven' where ven is the name of the virtual environment.
   Activate by 'ven/Scripts/activate' command.It can be deactivated by 'deactivate' command 

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

   print("Hello,World!")
   #prints "Hello,World!" to the screen
   The line that starts with '#' is a commentand are ignored by the interpreter,they are simply used to explain code and also improve readability.
   "Hello,World!" is a string literal in python and strings are sequences of characters enclosed within quotes,they can contain letters,numbers,symbols and spaces.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   Integer('int')-represents whole numbers ,positive or nagative without decimal points example; x=6,stores x as a whole number.
   Float('float')-represents realnumbers with a decimal point example;z=2.45,stores z as a decimal number
   String ('str')-represents sequences of characters enclosed withon quotes example;'name="Allan"',stores name as a text
   Boolean('bool')-represnts truth values 'True' or 'False'example;'is_student=True',indicates the person is a student
   List- represents ordered collection of items,which can be of different types,they are enclosed in square brackets[] and can be modified after creation example;'numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6],stores a list of numbers
   Tuples-they are similar to lists but they cannot be modified after creation and are enclosed in parantheses() example:'fruits=(mangoes,orsnges,bananas),stores the fruits
   Dictionary-represents key value pairs where each  key is unique and associated with a value and are enclosed in curly brackets{} example; 'student={'name'='Megan','age'=18,'gender'='female}, stores information about the student 
   Set-represents unordered collections of unique items,they can be modified after creation and are enclosed in curly braces and items are separated by commas example;'numbers={'1','2','5','6'}',stores unique numbers
   NoneType('None')-represents absence of a value or a null value example;'result=None',represents absence of a value

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether it is true or false.The main conditional statements are;if elseif and else
Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true or to iterate over sequences like lists or strings.there are for loops,while loops.
if-else statement;
x = 10
if x > 15:
     print("x is greater than 15")
else:
     print('x is not greater than 15")
     x = 10 defines a variable x and assigns it the value 1
     x > 15 checks if the value x is greater than 15
     print ("x is greater than 15")if the above condition, x > 15 evaluates to true this statement is executed and is printed on the screen.
     else: if the condition is false the next block of code is executed.
     For loop;
     fruits = ["apples","bananas","cherry"]
     for fruit in fruits:
         print(fruit)
   This will print each item in the fruits list on a new line

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

   Python functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.Python fuctions are useful because;
   they can be reused multiple times throughout a program or even in other programs,reducing duplication of code and promoting efficiency.Functions can make it easier to debig and maintain code because you can isolate and test specific parts of your program without affecting other parts.Functions also allow you to abstract away implementation details,focusing on what the function does rather how it does it making code easier to understand.Functions help break complex problems into smaller ,more manageable tasks.
   def calculate_sum(x , y) 
   sum_result = x + y
   return sum_result
   
   calling a function;
   num1 = 10
   num2 = 15
   result = calculate_sum (num1,num2)
   print(f"The sum of {num1} and{num2} is: {result})

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

   Lists are indexed by position while dictionaries are indexed by keys.
   Lists maintain the order of elements while dictionaries do not guarantee any specific order.
   Lists are accessed by index while dictionaries are accessed by keys.
   Use lists when you have an ordered collection of items that may change over time,use dictionaries when you need to associate unique keys with values and want fast lookup.
   numbers_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
   info_dict = {'name' = 'Rose','age' = 24,'gender' = 'female'}
   print("Initial list of numbers:", numbers_list)
   print("Initial dictonary:",info_dict)
   numbers_list,append (6) #Add an element to the list
   number_list.remove(2) #removes an element from the list
   print ("Element at index 2 in the list :",numbers[2])
   del info_dict['name']

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception handling inPython is a mechanism that allows one to gracefully handle runtime errors that may occur during the execution of your code.
Key concepts are try-except block,handling specific exceptions,handling multiple exceptions,handling generic exceptions,else blockand finally block.
try:
#code that may raise an exception
 x = 10 / 0 #division by zero
 except ZeroDivisionError:
 #handling specific exceptions
 print("Error: Division by zero!")
 except(ValueError , TypeError):
 print("Error: Invalid operation!")
 else:
 print("Division successful!")
 finally:
 print("Cleaning up resources...")

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

   Modules in python are files with .py extension that contain Python code.One can create modules by writing python code in a .py file.To import modules use the 'import' statement to make definitions from a module available in your current python script or interactive session.When a module is imported,its code is executed and definitions are added to the importing module's namespace.Modules have special attributes which stores the module's name.
   Packages are a way of structuring python's module namespace by using "dotted module names".A package is created by placing a file named'_init_.py' inside a directory.You import modules from a package using dot natation .Packages help in avoiding name clashes by providing a structured namespace .The '_init_.py' file inside a package directory can be used for initialization.
   example:
   my_package/
       _init_.py
       module1.py
       subpackage/
           _init_.py
           module2.py
    Importing modules:
           from my_package import module1
           from my_package.subpackage import moule2
    Accessing definitions:
           module1.function1()
           module2.function2()

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

    To read from files,open the file use 'open()' function,specify the file path and mode 'r'.read content using 'read()'.Close the file using 'close()'
    To write to a file,open the file with mode 'w' (write mode),write content using 'write()' and finally close the file using 'close()'
    example:
    file_path = 'example.txt'
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print("Content of the file:")
    print(content)
    example:
    file_path = 'output.txt'
    with open(file_path, 'w')as f:
    f.write("Yes, python!\n")
    f.write("This is a test file.\n")
